        # pyndb
        pyndb, short for Python Node Database, is a pacakge which makes it easy to save data to a file while also providing syntactic convenience. It utilizes a Node structure which allows for easily retrieving nested objects. All data is wrapped inside of a custom Node object, and stored to file as nested dictionaries. It  provides additional capabilities such as autosave, saving a dictionary to file, creating a file if none exists, and more. The original program was developed with  the sole purpose of saving dictionaries to files, and was not released to the public.
