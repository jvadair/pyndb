 PYN DB, originally named DataManager, is a method for easily saving  data to a file, while also providing syntactic convenience. It utilizes a Node structure which allows for easily retrieving nested objects. All data is stored  to file as nested dictionaries, and wrapped inside of a custom Node object. It  provides additional capabilities such as autosave, saving a dictionary to file,  creating a file if none exists, and more. The original program was developed with  the sole purpose of saving dictionaries to files, and was not released to the public.
